If they get 4, they will be stunned for ~10s. Be prepared to heal them. Also be careful about your own stacks as you may be stood still healing whilst *Snowdrift is rolling in. Also, give the DPS a hand with the *Frost bombs when you get a chance.\n\nDPS - Make sure when the *Frost bombs spawn you put them down ASAP",
